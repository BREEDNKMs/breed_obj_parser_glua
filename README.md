# breed_obj_parser_glua

A Mercury object data parser and object creator for Garry's Mod 

It's still WIP. To create an object, look up the object list from "objects" folder, pick yourself an object (those that start with "#DEF") and create with "ent_create basemercuryobject target /obname/". 

For example: 

ent_create basemercuryobject target FIGHTER 
ent_create basemercuryobject target UBERGUN_BASE 
ent_create basemercuryobject target BDROPSHIP
