# breed_obj_parser_glua

A Mercury object data parser and object creator for Garry's Mod. You can download related models at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnyQNU9oggiQZoHVh6tkvhnu06LjeETz/view?usp=share_link . Materials at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TROczmoU4AIVpg9YiStId82DaBS8Mk9g/view?usp=sharing

It's still WIP. To create an object, look up the object list from "objects" folder, pick yourself an object (those that start with "#DEF") and create with "ent_create basemercuryobject target /obname/". 

For example: 

ent_create basemercuryobject target FIGHTER 

ent_create basemercuryobject target UBERGUN_BASE 

ent_create basemercuryobject target BDROPSHIP
